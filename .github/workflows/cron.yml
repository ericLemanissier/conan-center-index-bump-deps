# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  schedule:
    - cron:  '0 * * * *'
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
